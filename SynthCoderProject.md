# SynthCoder's Unity Project Description
There are several different features SynthCoder and I worked on:
- Procedural environment (terrain, skybox, textures, etc)
- Shaders
- Procedural Helix and Spirals
- Procedurally generated meshes

Here's an example of some of the results:

## Procedural Environment
**Scene: Assets/SynthCoder/Scenes/SynthCoder_EnvironmentGeneration**  

### Procedurally generated terrain with a psychedelic shader

Includes procedural skybox and procedural texture generation and exporting to file.

## Procedural Helix and Spirals
**Scene: Assets/SynthCoder/Scenes/SynthCoder_SpiralsAndVFX**  

Customizable drag and drop scripts.

## Procedurally Generated Meshes
**Scene: Assets/SynthCoder/Scenes/SynthCoder_SacredGeometry**  

Customizable drag and drop script.  Goal is to generate complicated geometries.
